  in this project**, instread please send me a mail on GitHub@borrisholt.dk.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/JensBorrisholt/DelphiConsole/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/JensBorrisholt/DelphiConsole/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
